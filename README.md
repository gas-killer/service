Gas Killer service implementation built on EigenLayer with BLS signature aggregation for optimized transaction execution.

## Overview

The service coordinates multiple operator nodes to sign task digests, assembles their BN254 signatures into quorum certificates via the commonware-consensus aggregation engine, and executes the result onchain via `verifyAndUpdate`.

## Repository Structure

- **`router/`** — Router service: sequences tasks, assembles certificates (verifier-only engine), and executes onchain
- **`node/`** — Operator node: validates and signs tasks
- **`common/`** — Shared types, validation logic, and EVM gas analysis
- **`config/`** — Operator and orchestrator key/config files
- **`scripts/`** — Helper binaries for deployment and end-to-end testing
- **`helm/`** — Kubernetes Helm chart for full-stack deployment
- **`docker-compose.yml`** — One-command local deployment

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Configure environment:**
```bash
cp example.env .env
```

The example.env is pre-configured for LOCAL mode with Anvil test keys. No changes are needed to run locally.

2. **Start all services:**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will automatically pull the latest pre-built images from the GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) and start:
- Ethereum node (Anvil fork of Sepolia)
- EigenLayer contract deployment
- 3 operator nodes
- Router/orchestrator
- Signer service (Cerberus)

3. **Monitor services:**
```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f router

# Check service status
docker compose ps
```

### Stop Services

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clean state)
docker compose down -v
```

### Building from Source (Development Only)

If you're developing locally and want to test changes:

```bash
# Build the router image
docker build -t ghcr.io/gas-killer/service:router-local -f router/Dockerfile .

# Build the node image
docker build -t ghcr.io/gas-killer/service:node-local -f node/Dockerfile .

# Run with locally built images
docker compose up -d
```

## Architecture

Aggregation is built on the `commonware-consensus` **aggregation engine** with a custom
**BN254 attributable multisig scheme** (signer bitmap + one aggregated G1 signature per
certificate). The previous hand-rolled star-topology aggregator and all
`commonware-avs-*` / `commonware-restaking` git dependencies were dropped; the pieces
still required (BN254 key/curve handling, the EigenLayer staking client, the
`BLSApkRegistry`/`BLSSigCheckOperatorStateRetriever` bindings, and the
`NonSignerStakesAndSignature` retrieval flow) are vendored into `common/`. The on-chain
verification path (`GasKillerSDK.verifyAndUpdate` + `BLSSignatureChecker`) is unchanged.

```

        (rebroadcast until certified; Skip{H} after ROUND_TIMEOUT)

  │ node 1..N (signing participants)                     │ router (verifier-only)

```

- **Sequencer** (router): dequeues ingress tasks, computes the expected storage updates
  via EVMSketch, and assigns each task the next aggregation height. Exactly one height
  is outstanding at a time; the next task is assigned only after the current height
  certifies (and, for real digests, on-chain execution finishes).
- **Task-directive channel** (p2p channel 1): the router broadcasts
  `TaskDirective::Announce { height, task }` and, after `ROUND_TIMEOUT`,
  `TaskDirective::Skip { height }`. Nodes only receive on this channel. Engine `TipAck`
  gossip runs on channel 0.
- **Aggregation engine**: every process runs
  `commonware_consensus::aggregation::Engine`. Nodes run it as signing participants;
  the router runs it verifier-only (it holds no share of any signing key) — it
  validates the nodes' acks, assembles certificates at quorum, journals them, and
  hands them to the submitter.
- **BN254 multisig scheme**: nodes sign the raw 32-byte task digest with EigenLayer's
  `map_to_curve` hashing and **no namespace** — byte-identical to the pre-migration
  signatures — so certificates verify on-chain against the operators' registered BN254
  keys. The certificate binds only the digest, not the height; the digest itself binds
  `(transitionIndex, target, selector, storageUpdates)` and the contract enforces
  transition-index ordering, so replaying an identical digest across heights is
  harmless.
- **Submitter** (router): maps the certificate's signer bitmap to operator G1 keys,
  fetches `NonSignerStakesAndSignature` from `BLSSigCheckOperatorStateRetriever`, and
  calls `GasKillerSDK.verifyAndUpdate`.
- **Validator** (`common/`): EVM gas analysis (EVMSketch) computing the storage
  updates and the expected task digest on both router and nodes.

### Quorum model

The consensus engine fixes the certificate quorum at `n - floor((n - 1) / 3)` of the
`n` registered operators (Byzantine fault model, f = floor((n-1)/3)):

| n | quorum | tolerates |
|---|--------|-----------|
| 3 | 3-of-3 | 0 faulty  |
| 4 | 3-of-4 | 1 faulty  |
| 7 | 5-of-7 | 2 faulty  |

This is stricter than the old `ceil(2n/3)` threshold for n=3: **with 3 operators every
node must sign every certificate, so a single offline or divergent node halts
certification until it recovers.** Run **n ≥ 4 operators in production**. The old
`THRESHOLD` override is gone; the on-chain stake-fraction check
(`QUORUM_THRESHOLD`/`THRESHOLD_DENOMINATOR`) still runs in the contract at submission.

### Journal storage

Each process needs a writable directory (`STORAGE_DIR`) for the engine's journal — a
write-ahead log of acks and certificates replayed on restart. docker-compose mounts a
named volume per service at `/app/data`; the Helm chart mounts an `emptyDir`. A node
that loses its journal forgets what it acked (safe: it re-signs the same digests); the
router's journal only caches certificates and is likewise safe to lose. Without any
writable directory the binaries fall back to `$TMPDIR/gas-killer`, which is for
bare-metal dev runs only.

### Failure modes and recovery

The engine's tip advances only when heights certify contiguously — **every height the
router assigns must eventually resolve to a certificate**, either the task digest or
the skip digest. The router rebroadcasts `Announce` every `REBROADCAST_INTERVAL`,
switches to `Skip` after `ROUND_TIMEOUT`, and keeps rebroadcasting until the height
certifies. Nodes sign the skip digest only when told to (`Skip` directive) or when the
router has demonstrably moved past the height (a directive for a later height exists
while this one has none) — never on a bare timer.

- **Offline node (n=3)**: quorum is 3-of-3, so certification stalls until the node
  returns; acks are re-gossiped and the pipeline resumes on its own.
- **Split-digest stall**: if signers split between the task digest and the skip digest
  at the same height such that neither reaches quorum (with n=3 any single divergent
  signer is fatal; with n=4, two), the pipeline wedges at that height and **does not
  recover automatically**. Manual recovery: stop all node processes, wipe each node's
  engine journal — `docker compose down` + `docker volume rm <project>_node-{1,2,3}-data`,
  or delete the node pods in Kubernetes (journals are `emptyDir`) — and restart. Nodes
  then re-propose the height with no memory of their previous acks and follow the
  router's current directive. Running n ≥ 4 makes a single divergent signer non-fatal.
- **Router restart**: the engine replays its certificate journal, the sequencer waits
  a short settle delay, then resumes from the observed tip. A certificate whose digest
  matches neither the expected digest nor the skip digest (a node resolved the height
  from a directive issued by a previous router life) consumes the height and the
  in-flight task is re-assigned to the next one.
- **Router journal loss**: if the router's journal is wiped while the nodes keep
  theirs (e.g. only the router pod is rescheduled), the sequencer would restart at
  height 0 — below heights the nodes will ever propose again. Nodes detect directives
  below their own tip and reply with a rate-limited `TipReport`; the router takes the
  `(f+1)`-th highest reported tip (the same trust rule as the engine's safe-tip) and
  fast-forwards its next assignment, re-assigning the in-flight task there.
- **Operator-set changes**: the participant set (and therefore every participant
  index) is frozen per process at startup from the on-chain registry. Registering or
  deregistering an operator requires restarting the router and all nodes together —
  processes with different participant sets reject (and eventually disconnect) each
  other's acks.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:
- `ENVIRONMENT`: `LOCAL` or `TESTNET`
- `HTTP_RPC`: HTTP RPC endpoint
- `WS_RPC`: WebSocket RPC endpoint
- `AVS_DEPLOYMENT_PATH`: Path to deployment JSON file
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for transactions
- `FUNDED_KEY`: Funded key for testnet ETH (required for `TESTNET` mode)

LOCAL-mode-only:
- `FORK_URL`: Sepolia RPC URL to fork from (Anvil uses this)

Optional environment variables:
- `STORAGE_DIR`: Writable directory for the aggregation engine's journal (default: `/app/data` if writable, else `$TMPDIR/gas-killer`). docker-compose and Helm mount a dedicated volume here — see "Journal storage" above.
- `AGG_WINDOW`: Heights the aggregation engine works on concurrently above its tip (default: 8).
- `AGG_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT`: Heights below the tip the engine keeps tracking before pruning (default: 256). Keep generous — heights pruned past this window can never certify locally.
- `ROUND_TIMEOUT`: Max seconds the router waits for a certificate on its assigned height before switching from `Announce` to `Skip` broadcasts (accepts fractional seconds). Also the nodes' retry budget for transient validation errors. The engine certifies as soon as quorum signs, so this only affects heights that stall. Library default: 30; Helm deployments set 300. Must exceed worst-case node compute + sign time.
- `REBROADCAST_INTERVAL`: How often (in seconds) the router re-sends the in-flight `TaskDirective` until the height certifies (accepts fractional seconds); also the engine's internal `TipAck` rebroadcast timeout. Library default: 5; Helm deployments set 15. Must stay well below `ROUND_TIMEOUT`: a node that misses every `Announce` can only resolve the height as a skip.
- `INGRESS`: Enable HTTP ingress mode (true/false)
- `INGRESS_ADDRESS`: Address for ingress server (default: 0.0.0.0:8080)
- `INGRESS_TIMEOUT_MS`: Timeout for waiting on ingress tasks in milliseconds (default: 0, no timeout)
- `ADMIN_KEY`: Shared secret guarding the `/admin/keys` endpoints, used to mint and revoke the per-client API keys that authenticate `/trigger`. Omit or leave empty to disable the admin API.
- `RATE_LIMIT_RPM`: Default per-API-key request rate on `/trigger` (`POST /tasks`), in requests per minute (default: 60). Applies to every key without a per-key override (set at creation via the `rpm_limit` field of `POST /admin/keys`). Over-limit requests get `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header. Counters are in-memory per router process and reset on restart.
- `TASK_TTL_SECONDS`: How long a task may sit without reaching a terminal state before a background sweep settles it as `expired` (default: 600, the wall-clock life of a rendered payload on L1 — `PAYLOAD_BLOCK_BUFFER` blocks at a 12s slot time — so the sweep never withdraws a payload the chain would still accept; a target chain with faster blocks has a proportionally shorter payload window and can run a shorter TTL). A `queued` task past its TTL is expired with `QUEUE_TTL_EXCEEDED` — its pinned `block_height` has gone stale, so aggregating it would only produce a payload the contract rejects — and a `ready` payload nobody collected is expired with `READY_TTL_EXCEEDED` on the same TTL, counted from when aggregation recorded it, which frees the deduplication slot for its transition index. A `processing` task is never cancelled mid-round: its height is already assigned and must resolve either way. The sweep runs every 60 seconds and counts what it settles in `gas_killer_tasks_expired_total`.
- `QUORUM_NUMBER`: Quorum number to use (default: 0)
- `P2P_ACK_MESSAGES_PER_SECOND`: Per-peer rate for the engine's TipAck channel. Defaults to `2 * AGG_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT / REBROADCAST_INTERVAL + 8`, sized so steady-state ack rebroadcast never hits the p2p limiter (which silently drops over-rate messages). Only override to constrain bandwidth. The legacy `P2P_MESSAGES_PER_SECOND` knob now only governs the task-directive channel.

Removed after the aggregation migration:
- `THRESHOLD`: the minimum-signature override no longer exists — the quorum is fixed by the consensus engine at `n - floor((n-1)/3)` (see "Quorum model" above).

Operator (node) key files are generated automatically by the Docker setup and do not need to be set manually.

## Ingress Mode

Enable HTTP endpoints for external task requests:

1. **Enable ingress in .env:**
```bash
INGRESS=true
```

2. **Restart the router:**
```bash
docker compose restart router
```

3. **Trigger tasks via HTTP:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/trigger \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "body": {
      "target_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
      "from_address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002",
      "call_data": [171, 205, 239, 1],
      "transition_index": 0,
      "value": "0x0",
      "block_height": 1
    }
  }'
```

Note: `call_data` is a JSON array of bytes (not a hex string), `value` is a U256 hex string, and `block_height` must be non-zero.

When the router has a persistent store (the default), `/trigger` requires a valid API key, minted
through the admin API (`POST /admin/keys`) using `ADMIN_KEY`. The raw key is returned exactly
once. Locally (docker-compose) the admin API is on `localhost:8080`:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label": "my-client", "invalid_at": 1893456000}'   # invalid_at optional; unix ts, future
# → {"id":"...","key":"gk_...","label":"my-client","created_at":...,"invalid_at":1893456000}
```

Add `rpm_limit` (requests per minute) to the create body to give a key a custom rate; omit it to
use the global `RATE_LIMIT_RPM` default. Each key is rate-limited on `/trigger`: over-limit requests
return `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header (seconds until the next request is
allowed). The limiter is a token bucket, not a strict rolling window — a key may burst up to its
full per-minute allowance at once, after which requests refill at roughly `rpm / 60` per second.
Counters are in-memory per router process and reset on restart.

On a Kubernetes deployment the `/admin/*` endpoints are **not** exposed through the public Ingress
(only `/trigger`, `/avs-metadata`, `/healthz` are — see `ingress.publicPaths` in the chart).
Reach them in-cluster. The `create_api_key` tool ships in the router image, defaults to the
in-cluster `http://localhost:8080`, and reads `ADMIN_KEY` from the pod env — so `kubectl exec`
needs no target flag:
```bash
POD=$(kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=router -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec "$POD" -- create_api_key --label my-client --expires-at "7 days"
# fallback if the binary predates the image: curl localhost:8080/admin/keys with $ADMIN_KEY
```
Or `kubectl port-forward svc/<release>-router 8080:8080` and run the tool locally, reading
`ADMIN_KEY` from the Secret (it still defaults to `http://localhost:8080`):
```bash
ADMIN_KEY=$(kubectl get secret <release>-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.ADMIN_KEY}' | base64 -d) \
  create_api_key --label my-client --expires-at "7 days"
```
`--expires-at` accepts `never`, a relative duration like `7 days`, or a unix timestamp. The tool's
`--env prod`/`--env testnet` shortcuts target the public hostnames, so they work only if you have
deliberately added `/admin` to `ingress.publicPaths` — otherwise they 404 at the edge.

Then include the minted key as the Bearer token on task requests (revoke via the same in-cluster
admin path when no longer needed):
```bash
curl -X POST https://<host>/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer gk_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '...'
```

Use the `send_request` script for a complete end-to-end trigger against an ArraySummation contract.
Set `GAS_KILLER_API_KEY` to a minted key when the router requires auth:
```bash
GAS_KILLER_API_KEY=gk_... cargo run -p scripts --bin send_request
```

## Development

### Dependencies
- `alloy`: Ethereum interaction
- `commonware-consensus`: Aggregation engine (certificate assembly over heights)
- `commonware-cryptography`: Cryptographic primitives and the certificate `Scheme` trait implemented by our BN254 multisig scheme
- `commonware-p2p`: P2P networking
- `commonware-runtime`: Runtime utilities and journal-backed storage
- `gas-analyzer-evmsketch`: EVM gas analysis and storage update computation
- `eigen-*` / `ark-*`: EigenLayer SDK and BN254 curve arithmetic

The former `commonware-avs-*` (`commonware-restaking`) git dependencies were dropped in
the aggregation migration; the parts still needed are vendored under `common/src/`
(`bn254/`, `eigenlayer.rs`, `bindings/`).
