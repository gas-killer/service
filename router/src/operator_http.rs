//! The operator HTTP surface: Kubernetes probes and the Prometheus scrape endpoint.
//!
//! Served on its own listener (`HEALTHZ_PORT`, 8081 by default) rather than on the ingress, so a
//! cluster can probe and scrape the router without any of it being reachable through the public
//! ingress. The chart's `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` both point here.
//!
//! [`healthz_handler`] is the exception: the ingress serves the same handler on its own port as
//! well, because the public ingress allowlists `/healthz` and the local scripts check it there.
//! One handler, two listeners, and one entry in the OpenAPI document naming both.
