//! TaskBook actor: resolves aggregation heights to the router's task directives.
//!
//! The aggregation engine calls `Automaton::propose(h)` for every height in its
//! window, but which task (if any) lives at `h` is decided solely by the router's
//! [`TaskDirective`] broadcasts on p2p channel 1. The TaskBook bridges the two: it
//! owns the directive log and hands out await-able per-height resolutions.
//!
//! # Skip rules (NORMATIVE — DESIGN.md "Liveness model")
//!
//! A pending height `h` resolves to [`Resolution::Skip`] only when:
//! 1. an explicit `TaskDirective::Skip { h }` arrives, OR
//! 2. a directive for some `h' > h` arrives while `h` has no directive — evidence
//!    the router moved past `h` (it serializes assignments, so a directive at `h'`
//!    means every unassigned lower height was abandoned).
//!
//! There are NO timer-based skips: propose futures for unassigned heights simply
//! stay parked until the router says otherwise. The engine proposes heights
//! `[tip, tip+window)` eagerly at startup, so parked waiters during idle periods
//! are normal — resolving them on a timer would burn heights and generate constant
//! skip-certificate churn.
//!
//! # Idempotency
//!
//! The router rebroadcasts directives until a height certifies, so duplicates are
//! expected: the FIRST directive recorded for a height wins, replays are ignored,
//! and a conflicting directive for the same height is logged and dropped (the
//! engine only asks for each height's digest once, so flip-flopping would be
//! unobservable anyway — divergence recovery is the router's job).
