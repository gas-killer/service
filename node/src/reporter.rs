//! Minimal aggregation [`Reporter`]: certificate/tip accounting for the node.
//!
//! The engine reports [`Activity`] inline from its event loop (and re-reports the
//! whole journal on restart replay), so the reporter must be non-blocking and
//! replay-idempotent. This one is a mailbox actor: [`ReporterMailbox::report`]
//! only enqueues; the [`NodeReporter`] actor deduplicates certificates by height,
//! tracks the highest observed height for metrics, and drives [`TaskBook`]
//! pruning so directive state does not grow without bound.
//!
//! Nodes do not submit certificates on-chain (that is the router's job), so the
//! full certificate payload is only logged here, never stored.
