//! Resolves the contract addresses that make up a deployment's settlement wiring.
//!
//! A target contract must be wired to two addresses: the AVS service manager and the fleet's
//! `SchnorrStakeRegistry`. Get the registry wrong and the target still passes every router-side
//! check — it is handed a `ready` payload — and then reverts `InvalidQuorumSignature` on chain,
//! because it verifies against a superseded operator set. Publishing the pair from the running
//! deployment is what makes that unwireable by accident.
//!
//! The router publishes the resolved set as the `contracts` block on `GET /avs-metadata`, which is
//! what saves an integrator from hand-copying any of it — hand-copied addresses are exactly what
//! goes stale when the operator set is redeployed.
//!
//! - The fleet's `schnorrStakeRegistry` comes from `SCHNORR_STAKE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`, or failing
//!   that from the record the operator-set job writes, or failing that from `avs_deploy.json`, and
//!   publishes only once a registry answers at it.
//! - `avsAddress` is read from a live reference target's own getter, and the target's
//!   `schnorrRegistry()` is cross-checked against the fleet's. A target wired to any other registry
//!   belongs to a superseded deployment, so nothing is published rather than a pair that reverts.
//! - `registryCoordinator` comes from the same `avs_deploy.json` loader the rest of the service
//!   reads. Nothing on chain ties it to the registry, so it is advisory only.
//! - `demoTarget` and `demoFactory` come from configuration or, failing that, from a deploy job's
//!   record. A recorded demo target doubles as the preferred reference target, so the registry
//!   published is the one `demoTarget` itself returns.
//!
//! Resolution costs up to eight RPC round-trips, so the answer is cached in a
//! [`ResolvedContracts`] slot rather than recomputed per use: `/avs-metadata` is public and
//! unauthenticated, and serving it must not turn into an RPC amplifier.
//!
//! The slot holds the most complete set established so far, and a background resolver keeps
//! refining it. That matters because the records it reads are written by deploy jobs that can
//! finish — or fail outright — after the router is already serving: waiting for all of them before
//! publishing anything would let one broken job withhold addresses that have nothing to do with it,
//! while publishing once and stopping would miss a record that lands a minute later. So an attempt
//! publishes what it can establish, and repeats while any record a job is expected to write is
//! still unread.
