//! Resolves the contract addresses that make up a deployment's settlement wiring.
//!
//! A target contract must be wired to two addresses: the AVS service manager and the
//! `IBLSSignatureChecker`. Get the checker wrong and the target still passes every router-side
//! check — it is handed a `ready` payload — and then reverts `InvalidQuorumApkHash` on chain,
//! because the router computes quorum APK indices against the live registry while the contract
//! checks them against a superseded one. Publishing the pair from the running deployment is what
//! makes that unwireable by accident.
//!
//! The set is shared because the wiring is: the router aggregates certificates against the
//! operators' registry coordinator and submits to a target that verifies through the checker, and a
//! node validates work for that same deployment. The router also publishes the resolved set as the
//! `contracts` block on `GET /avs-metadata`, which is what saves an integrator from hand-copying
//! any of it — hand-copied addresses are exactly what goes stale when the operator set is
//! redeployed.
//!
//! - `registryCoordinator` comes from the same `avs_deploy.json` loader the rest of the service
//!   reads, so there is one parser for that file.
//! - `avsAddress` and `blsSignatureChecker` are read from a live target's own getters, so they are
//!   authoritative by construction: whatever a settling target verifies against *is* the answer.
//!   In particular the checker is not `avs_deploy.json`'s `blsSigCheck` — upstream maps that key
//!   onto the operator-state retriever, and the target deploy script provisions a fresh checker
//!   from the registry coordinator, so that field names a different contract than any target uses.
//! - The two are then cross-checked: the checker's own `registryCoordinator()` must be the
//!   coordinator the operators are registered in. A mismatch means the reference target belongs to
//!   a superseded deployment, so nothing is published rather than publishing a pair that reverts.
//! - `demoTarget` and `demoFactory` come from configuration or, failing that, from what the
//!   playground job recorded. The playground target doubles as the preferred reference target, so
//!   the checker published is the one `demoTarget.blsSignatureChecker()` itself returns.
//!
//! Resolution costs four RPC round-trips, so the answer is cached in a [`ResolvedContracts`] slot
//! rather than recomputed per use: `/avs-metadata` is public and unauthenticated, and serving it
//! must not turn into an RPC amplifier.
//!
//! The slot holds the most complete set established so far, and a background resolver keeps
//! refining it. That matters because the records it reads are written by deploy jobs that can
//! finish — or fail outright — after the router is already serving: waiting for all of them before
//! publishing anything would let one broken job withhold addresses that have nothing to do with it,
//! while publishing once and stopping would miss a record that lands a minute later. So an attempt
//! publishes what it can establish, and repeats while any record a job is expected to write is
//! still unread.
